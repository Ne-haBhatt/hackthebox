# Quantum-Safe

## CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
I heard Shor's algorithm can do all sorts of nasty things to RSA, so I've decided to be super modern and protect my flag with cool new maffs!

### STEPS:
1. Download the required files.
2. Install the numpy module using ' pip install numpy'
3. Write the python code.
4. Run the code and you will get the flag.
