# Photon Lockdown
## Challenge Description: 
We've located the adversary's location and must now secure access to their Optical Network Terminal to disable their internet connection. Fortunately, we've obtained a copy of the device's firmware, which is suspected to contain hardcoded credentials. Can you extract the password from it?

## STEPS
Download zip file. Extract it and write the password "hackthebox" . Open the extracted file in terminal.
