# Primed for Action

## CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
Intelligence units have intercepted a list of numbers. They seem to be used in a peculiar way: the adversary seems to be sending a list of numbers, most of which are garbage, but two of which are prime. These 2 prime numbers appear to form a key, which is obtained by multiplying the two. Your answer is the product of the two prime numbers. Find the key and help us solve the case.
